### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Daniel. I do stuff with computers. If I had to give myself a title for my current type of work, it would be automation engineer. My day-to-day work currently involves working with [AWS CDK] and [Ansible].

I'm born and living in [Frankfurt] ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª. In between though I've been living for 16 years in [Berlin] ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª and 3 years in [Udon Thani] ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡­. I'm married and I have 3 children.

I've been working for almost 9 years at [Groupon]. It was a great experience with awesome people, but I ultimately decided I did no longer want to waste my life maxing out  profits and sell electronic and plastic crap nobody needs, just so more of it can be produced.

I'm currently working for [DB Systel], the IT branch of the Deutsche Bahn, trying to improve and reduce cost for public transportation. Chuu chuu! ðŸš† ðŸŒ³ ðŸŒž

My favorite programming language is Go, though I have recently learned to love TypeScript. I'm sure this list won't be complete but I have also worked with: Python, Ruby, C++, C#, Swift, PHP, JavaScript, ActionScript, HTML, CSS, ...

My current pet project is [IAM Floyd][iam-floyd], an AWS IAM statement generator with a fluent interface.
